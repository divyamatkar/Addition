    <p>Aim:To write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a given number.</p>
    <p>Objective:</p>
    <li>
        <ul>To understand the concept of loops in JavaScript.</ul>
        <ul>To learn how to take user input and display output using the DOM (Document Object Model).</ul>
        <ul>To develop a simple mathematical program using JavaScript.</ul>
    </li>
    <p>
        Theory:A factorial of a number n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
           Example:
           3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
           5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
           By definition: 0! = 1
        JavaScript provides looping structures such as for, while, and do-while loops.
         In this program, a for loop is used to multiply numbers from 1 to n to calculate the factorial.
    </p>
    <p>Conclusion: By performing this program, we learned how to calculate the factorial of a number using JavaScript loops and interact with web page elements using the DOM. This enhanced understanding of logic building, looping, and dynamic webpage behavior.</p>
