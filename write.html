    </p>

    <h2>Objectives:</h2>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Theory:</h2>

    <h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h3>
    <p>
        HTML provides the structure of the form. Elements such as
        <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
        are used to capture user information like name, email, rating, suggestions, and comments.
    </p>

    <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
    <p>
        CSS is used to enhance the appearance and layout of the form.
        Properties such as <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>border-radius</code>,
        <code>background-color</code>, and <code>box-shadow</code> are used to style the feedback form and
        improve readability.
    </p>

    <h3>Bootstrap:</h3>
    <p>
        Bootstrap is a front-end framework that simplifies responsive web design.
        It provides ready-made classes like <code>form-control</code>, <code>form-select</code>,
        <code>btn</code>, <code>container</code>, <code>mb-3</code>, and <code>text-center</code> to create
        a visually appealing and mobile-friendly layout.
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose of Feedback Form:</h3>
    <p>Feedback forms collect user experience data which helps improve the system. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Satisfaction rating</li>
        <li>Suggestions for improvements</li>
        <li>Additional comments</li>
        <li>Communication preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Such feedback is important for enhancing usability and improving user satisfaction in the e-commerce dashboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
        By developing this feedback form using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, we learned how to build a responsive,
        structured, and user-friendly interface to collect user feedback. This practical enhanced understanding of
        form elements, styling, and responsiveness, and demonstrated how web technologies can be used to gather
        valuable user insights for improving an e-commerce platform.
