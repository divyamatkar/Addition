    <h1>Addition Program Using JavaScript</h1>

    <h2>Aim:</h2>
    <p>
        To create a JavaScript program that performs the addition of two numbers by taking user input 
        and displaying the result on a webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To understand how to take input values from the user using HTML input elements.</li>
        <li>To apply JavaScript for performing arithmetic operations.</li>
        <li>To dynamically display the output using DOM manipulation.</li>
        <li>To enhance user interaction through a graphical interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Theory:</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used to make web pages interactive. 
        Addition is a basic arithmetic operation where two numeric values are summed to get a final result.
    </p>

    <p>To build this program, the following concepts are used:</p>

    <h3>HTML Input Fields:</h3>
    <p><code>&lt;input type="number"&gt;</code> is used to allow users to enter numeric values.</p>

    <h3>JavaScript Variables and Operators:</h3>
    <p>
        Variables are used to store the values entered by the user, and the <code>+</code> operator 
        is used to perform the addition operation.
    </p>

    <h3>DOM Manipulation:</h3>
    <p>
        The method <code>document.getElementById()</code> is used to fetch input values and display 
        the result dynamically without refreshing the webpage.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example calculation:</strong><br>
        If number1 = 10 and number2 = 5 → Result = 10 + 5 = 15
    </p>

    <p>
        This demonstrates how JavaScript connects with HTML to create interactive applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
        By performing this program, we successfully learned how to accept user input and process arithmetic 
        operations using JavaScript. This practical helped us understand DOM manipulation, event handling, 
        and how JavaScript enhances webpage interactivity by showing results instantly.
